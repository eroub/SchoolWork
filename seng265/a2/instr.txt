Let's see how nice I can make this mtf compression algorithm :)

if n is in wordlist
	put hex value 81+(word_list[index]) in outfile
	push n in word_list to front
if n is not in wordlist
	put n at end of word_list
		** probably don't need to do above step
	put hex value 81+(word_list[index]) in outfile
	push n in wordlist to front
