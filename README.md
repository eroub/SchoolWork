# SchoolWork

Here lie all my school work pertaining to programming thus far. There's probably more lost somewhere.

So far I've worked mainly with C & Java. With developing proficiences with BASH and python.

Have worked with HTML, CSS on my own time. With some JavaScript experience from highschool.
